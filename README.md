# World Weather Analysis
The purpose of this project was to engage in the use of APIs for retrieving data from websites.  On this particular project, we were tasked with using the Google Maps API to retrieve weather and location data to assist in the development of a vacation itinerary for an individual based on input they provided re: optimum temperature ranges.  Using the acquired API key, data regarding the weather for identified longitude and latitude combinationss was obtained.  In addition, multiple locations were selected and a full travel itinerary was developed using directions obtained through APIs.  maps were generated for each step of the project to show the locations identified, directions obtained for the itinerary, and the weather conditions for each location.
